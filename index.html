          <h2>Why can Asian America be found here?</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-5">This apartment is made up of five tenants: four Korean American college students and one Latinx college student. While the apartment is made up mostly of Asian Americans, what I found intriguing about this apartment is that many other Korean American and Asian American college students frequent this apartment for parties, small social gatherings, and even to do homework. I wanted to know what makes this such a safe space that attracts other Korean Americans. </p>

          <h2>What does Alex say?</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-5">Alex is the sole Mexican American in the apartment, but he still feels comfortable in the Korean American dominated apartment. He grew up in a very diverse part of the south side of Chicago, so he has been exposed to many different cultures since his youth. He feels very connected to the core values of his Mexican heritage, including serving others, which is also an important core value in Korean culture as well. Because of this, Alex feels that he gets along best with his roommate, John Lim, who also has a close cultural affinity with his Korean heritage. Although most of the parties hosted at 3E consist of Korean Americans, Alex still participates and gets along with them, but also sometimes chooses to stay in his room during these events. Regardless of what he chooses to do, he has no problem with the events that happen at 3E.</p>

            <h2>What does Andrew say?</h2>
            <p class="lead mb-5">Andrew grew up in a place with a large Asian American population, so he never felt discriminated by his peers or his teachers. Because he always had Asian American friends, he sought out the Asian American community in Northwestern as well, but specifically Korean Americans. He joined the Korean American Student Association, where he met most of the people who would be in his friend group today. He met one of his current roommates, David Kwon when he came to Northwestern for a 5-week program before the start of freshman year and since then, they've continually added people to this friend group, some of whom would become their roommates today. Andrew says he "vibes better" with other Korean Americans, and as a result, most of the people invited to apartment 3E are also Korean Americans.</p>

          <h2>Evaluation of 3E</h2>
          <h4>Why is 3E a hub for young Asian Americans on campus and how are the relationships of the tenants affected by their affinity to home culture?</h4>
          <br>
          <p class="lead mb-5">What I wanted to find out about this apartment and its Asian America was both how people felt safe and attracted to that apartment as well as how each tenant's background affected 
            day-to-day interactions with the others. I found that those with close cultural affinity to their homeland (both Mexican American and Korean American) found themselves to be more
            other-centered while those with a closer affinity to US culture found themselves to be more ego-centered. Furthermore, this affected their relationships to each other in small ways, such as doing the dishes for others as well as cleaning up after each other. 
            Andrew and Alex both stated in their interviews that they feel closer to some roommates over others due to their day-to-day interactions that are guided by their culture's values. 
          </p>
          <p class="lead mb-5"> 
            When asked about whom the tenants invite, they said that they didn't specifically had any criteria. However, I have noticed that many of the guests at the apartment, if not all, have been Asian Americans or Mexican Americans. 
            While I won't dive deeper into why that is the case as that is beyond the scope of my project, I can relate the attendance to the fact that the interviewees said they specifically reached out to other ethnically and culturally similar to them when they initially came to Northwestern.
